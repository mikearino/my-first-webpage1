    <h1>These are my favorite places to visit!</h1>
    <h2>Mexico</h2>
      <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8RTyW5L.jpg" alt="a giant sinkhole">
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico">Mexico</a> is rad and the
      Cenotes are so unbelievably cool! They are underground caves full of
      crystal clear water.</p>
    <h2>Hawaii</h2>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/qDRWr5r.jpg" alt="a beach in Hawaii">
      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii">Hawaii</a> is an amazing
         place. If I could be anywhere right now, I would be snorkeling on one
         of their beaches, getting blasted by the sun.</p>
    <h3>Japan</h3>

      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan">Japan</a> is an amazing
      place. They embrace technology and have so many wonderful bits to offer.
      I visited there in highschool and I would really love to go back someday.
