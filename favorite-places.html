    <h1>These are my favorite places to visit!</h1>
    <h2>Mexico</h2>
      <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8RTyW5L.jpg" alt="a giant sinkhole">
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico">Mexico</a> is rad and the
      Cenotes are so unbelievably cool! They are underground caves full of
      crystal clear water.</p>
    <h2>Hawaii</h2>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/qDRWr5r.jpg" alt="a beach in Hawaii">
      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii">Hawaii</a> is an <em>
        amazing</em> place. If I could be anywhere right now, I would be
        snorkeling on one of their beaches, getting blasted by the sun.</p>
    <h2>Japan</h2>

      wipe station">
      <p class="jp"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan">Japan</a> is
         <em>so cool!</em> They embrace technology and have so many wonderful
         bits to offer. I visited there in highschool and I would really love
         to go <st>back someday</st>.
